##  *Procedure*

1. Connect the circuit as per the given circuit diagram.  
2. Switch ON the RPS and set a desired input voltage.  
3. Measure voltages & currents using the voltmeters and ammeters; tabulate the readings.  
4. Change the RPS value and repeat the measurement process.  
5. After taking all readings, reduce RPS to minimum and turn OFF the supply.  
6. Using the tabulated values, verify Mesh analysis theoretically and practically.

##  *Result*

Thus, *Mesh Analysis is verified both theoretically and practically*.

The calculated currents for the given supply are:

- *Current through R1 = 2.508 A*  
- *Current through R2 = 2.3006 A*  
- *Current through R3 = 0.511 A*
